# What is this

These are the configuration file for bash, vim, etc that I like to use. 

# How to Use

Run setup script. This will get git, Python and other essential programs. Read
the setup_script for complete listing. After this, open Vim and rung
:PluginInstall. This will install all the Vim plugins that are listed in the
~/.vimrc file. Finally, run the YCM_install.sh with the number of cores to use.
For example ~~./YCM_install.sh 4~~ for a 4 core compilation

Now you should be good to go! If there is a problem, IDK, fix it?


# What about the RC files?

Good luck with the RC files. These should be able to be copied to the home
directory. As far as what they do, you'll need to go through and learn what is
going on.
