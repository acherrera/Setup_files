# What is this

These are the configuration file for bash, vim, etc that I like to use. I am
also considering backing up my .vim/ folder in order to keep the changes there
also. 

# How to Use

Run setup script. This will get git, Python and other essential programs. Read
the setup_script for complete listing. After this, open Vim and rung
:PluginInstall. This will install all the Vim plugins that are listed in the
~/.vimrc file. Finally, run the YCM_install.sh with the number of cores to use.
For example ~~./YCM_install.sh 4~~ for a 4 core compilation

Now you should be good to go! If there is a problem, IDK, fix it.
